## Need an app to secret your santa? well this is your baby.

## How it works
The first user signs up, creates a group and becomes admin of that group for the current season. Admin user can then invite others to the group via email. Once all have registered, admin can "Assign Santas" and users will see who they have been randomly assigned and will be notified via email.
